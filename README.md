* `mailer.rb` - setup default hosts for mailer from configuration
* `requires.rb` - automatically requires everything in lib/ & lib/extensions
* `rack_cors.rb` - setup whitelist of domains to allow cross-origin resource sharing

### Scripts

* `bin/setup` - setup required gems and migrate db if needed
* `bin/quality` - runs rubocop, brakeman, rails_best_practices and bundle-audit for the app
* `bin/ci` - should be used in the CI or locally
* `bin/server` - to run server locally

### Serializers

### PaginatedArraySerializer

Use that serializer if you want to add meta with pagination info on response

```ruby
def index
  respond_with(
    posts,
    serializer: PaginatedArraySerializer
  )
end
```

The above usage of `PaginatedArraySerializer` will produce the following:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      "total":46,
      "per_page":2,
      "page":1
    }
  },
  "posts": [
    { "title": "Post 1", "body": "Hello!" },
    { "title": "Post 2", "body": "Goodbye!" }
  ]
}
```

## Quick start
